1. DevOps Introduction  
What is DevOps? 
DevOps = Development + Operations 
It's a culture + set of practices + tools that help: 
      • Developers (who write code) 
      • Operations (who deploy/manage systems) 
Work together, instead of working in silos. 
Real-Time Example: 
Imagine you're building a mobile app like Swiggy. 
        • The developer writes code to add "Track My Order" feature. 
        • Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team → they manually 
deploy → bugs happen → delays. 
        • With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed → customers 
get updates faster and safely. 
DevOps Helps You: 
        • Release features faster (like adding new payment methods in Zomato) 
        • Fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issue in IRCTC) 
       • Automate repetitive tasks (like server restarts, database backups) 
2. DevOps Lifecycle
